# Order Source Reservations

### Backstory

We had a requirement to make a connection with a fulfillment warehouse, we
wanted to be future-proof and want to intergrate it with the new Multi Source
Inventory functionality introduced in Magento 2.3 If you don't fully understand
MSI yet, please read our blogpost
[The Definitive Guide to Magento MSI Multi Source Inventory](https://www.reachdigital.nl/en/blog/magento-msi-multi-source-inventory-features)).

While writing specifications for the integration with the warehouse it came to
our attention that MSI has a feature-gap regarding the creation of shipments:

We need to make an API-call to the actual source (warehouse) to actually request
a shipment for the ordered products. But to know what to actually communicate to
the warehouse, the Source Selection Algorithm needs to have run. We can't run
that algorithm during the shipment creation because the product hasn't actually
shipped and thus the source isn't deducted at that point.

### Proposed solution

To implement a warehouse connector based on MSI, we need to know to what
warehouse to send which products. The warehouse selection is done in MSI with
the Souce Selection Algorithm. The SSA is triggered via the UI, right before
creating the shipment.

The feature-gap here is that we need the result of the SSA, because we need to
send an API call at some point to the warehouse... After we've send the API
calls to the warehouse we cant have the result of the SSA be changed.

1. If the SSA has been ran a single time we need to store the result, it can't
   change.
2. If an item has a source selected we have a moment to send of an API call to
   the warehouse.

To store the result of the SSA we make an
[Inventory Source Reservations](https://github.com/ho-nl/magento2-ReachDigital_InventorySourceReservations).

#### Flow

- ðŸ”¸ Already handled by Magento
- ðŸ”¹ Added by this package

Order created:

- ðŸ”¸Create StockReservations âœ…

Invoice created:

- ðŸ”¹Cron to ðŸ”¹Add SourceReservations + ðŸ”¹Revert StockReservations âœ…

Shipment Created

- ðŸ”¹Revert SourceReservations instead of Stock + ðŸ”¸Deduct Source âœ…

Order Cancelled

- ðŸ”¸Revert StockReservations âœ…

Credit Order when not shipped:

- ðŸ”¹Revert Source Reservations by refunded qty, if reservation exists. âœ…
- ðŸ”¹Low Prio: Hide 'Return Qty to Source' because it isn't deducted yet.

Credit Order when shipped:

- ðŸ”¸Increment Source âœ…

### Step by step

1. Order created: When a new order is created in Magento MSI will make a
   reservation on the StockðŸ”¸, this will be exactly the same.

   - Order Cancelled: The Stock reservation is nullified and the qty is released
     to be sold again.

2. Create invoice: ðŸ”¹Cron
   [MoveReservationsFromStockToSourceRunner](https://github.com/ho-nl/magento2-ReachDigital_InventoryOrderSourceReservations/blob/master/IOSReservations/Model/MoveReservationsFromStockToSourceRunner.php#L65-L78):
   Periodically we run the 'heavy' SSA on all orders that are succesfully
   invoiced (and therefor authorized to be shipped).

   - ðŸ”¹[OrderSelectionService](https://github.com/ho-nl/magento2-ReachDigital_InventoryOrderSourceReservations/blob/master/IOSReservationsPriorityApi/Api/OrderSelectionServiceInterface.php)
     will return a list of unsourced orders based on a certain algorithm (only
     byDateCreated implemented right now).
   - ðŸ”¹[Selection criteria](https://github.com/ho-nl/magento2-ReachDigital_InventoryOrderSourceReservations/blob/master/IOSReservationsPriority/Model/Algorithms/ByDateCreatedAlgorithm.php#L63-L65)
     All state:processing and unsourced orders.
   - ðŸ”¹[MoveReservationsFromStockToSource](https://github.com/ho-nl/magento2-ReachDigital_InventoryOrderSourceReservations/blob/master/IOSReservations/Model/MoveReservationsFromStockToSource.php)
     Will actually move the reservations from the Stock to the Source.
   - To integrate with a warehouse it becomes trivial to find a point where to
     hook into, to actually send the reservations to the actual warehouse:
     ðŸ”¹afterExecute on MoveReservationsFromStockToSource.

3. Create shipment

   - ðŸ”¹
     [DeductSourceAndNullifyReservationOnShipment](https://github.com/ho-nl/magento2-ReachDigital_InventoryOrderSourceReservations/blob/master/IOSReservations/Plugin/MagentoInventoryShipping/DeductSourceAndNullifyReservationOnShipment.php#L103-L130):
     Instead of nullifying MSI's Stock Reservation we now nullify the Source
     Reservation. The Stock reservation already happened in step two.
   - The SSA will always return the earlier created reservations: ðŸ”¹
     [PriorityBasedAlgorithmWithSourceReservations](https://github.com/ho-nl/magento2-ReachDigital_InventoryOrderSourceReservations/blob/master/IOSReservations/Plugin/InventorySourceSelection/PriorityBasedAlgorithmWithSourceReservations.php#L101-L103)

4. Create creditmemo:
   - ðŸ”¹
     [RevertSourceReservationsOnCreditBeforeShipment](https://github.com/ho-nl/magento2-ReachDigital_InventoryOrderSourceReservations/blob/master/IOSReservations/Plugin/MagentoInventorySales/RevertSourceReservationsOnCreditBeforeShipment.php)
     will automatically reverty any source reservations.

### REST Api / Internal Api

Adds a filter to
[`GET /orders`](https://devdocs.magento.com/redoc/2.3/admin-rest-api.html#tag/orders)
called `assigned_source_code`.

```
searchCriteria[filterGroups][0][filters][0][conditionType] = 'eq';
searchCriteria[filterGroups][0][filters][0][field] = 'assigned_source_code';
searchCriteria[filterGroups][0][filters][0][value] = 'eu-1';
```

Adds `source_reservations` as an extension attribute on an order item, which
allows you to see the sources that are assigned to an order item.
