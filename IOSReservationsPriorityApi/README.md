# Inventory Order Source Reservations Priority Api

Responsibility: Provides a list of orders that need to be sourced, but allows us
to define an algorithm which provides a list of orders and its sort order that
shall be sourced by the IOSReservations module.

Modules:

- Inventory Order Source Reservations Priority Api
- Inventory Order Source Reservations Priority
- Inventory Order Source Reservations Priority Admin UI

Implementations: Currently there is only one Algorithm implemented:
`\ReachDigital\IOSReservationsPriority\Model\Algorithms\ByDateCreatedAlgorithm`
which will provide a list of unsourced orders based on their date placed.
